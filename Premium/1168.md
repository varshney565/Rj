There are n houses in a village. We want to supply water for all the houses by building wells and laying pipes.

For each house i, we can either build a well inside it directly with cost wells[i], or pipe in water from another well to it. The costs to lay pipes between houses are given by the array pipes, where each pipes[i] = [house1, house2, cost] represents the cost to connect house1 and house2 together using a pipe. Connections are bidirectional.

Find the minimum total cost to supply water to all houses.

Example 1:

Input: n = 3, wells = [1,2,2], pipes = [[1,2,1],[2,3,1]]<br>
Output: 3<br>
Explanation:<br> 
The best strategy is to build a well in the first house with cost 1 and connect the other houses to it with cost 2 so the total cost is 3.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10000<br>
wells.length == n<br>
0 <= wells[i] <= 10^5<br>
1 <= pipes.length <= 10000<br>
1 <= pipes[i][0], pipes[i][1] <= n<br>
0 <= pipes[i][2] <= 10^5<br>
pipes[i][0] != pipes[i][1]<br>
